# Clothing Image Classification using Deep Learning and MNIST Dataset

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates clothing image classification using deep learning techniques and the MNIST dataset. The project focuses on building and training a neural network to classify images of various clothing items with the help of TensorFlow and Keras.

## Introduction
In this project, we develop a deep neural network to classify clothing images into distinct categories using the MNIST dataset, which has been adapted to include clothing labels. The primary aim is to provide a clear example of image classification, suitable for both educational and practical purposes.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset, initially created for digit recognition, has been preprocessed for clothing image classification. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images, each measuring 28x28 pixels. The dataset is divided into 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples, covering various types of clothing items.

## Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of 88.29% on the test dataset, showcasing its effectiveness in classifying different clothing items. The code and comments in the `main.py` file provide a step-by-step understanding of the process, making it suitable for learning and experimentation.
